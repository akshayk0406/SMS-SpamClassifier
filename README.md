SMS-SpamClassifier
==================

In this project a classifier is built to distinguish between spam and non-spam SMS. Data for this project has been collected from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection

Firstly, we use naive bayes algorithm for classification. The accuracy we achieve is around 94%. We plot a graph between training samples and accuracy and we observe that performance keeps growing, both for training and cross validation scores. Since our model is not complex enough it may not abe able to capture all nuance. Then we use Support vector machines for classifiction of SMS. The accuracy achieved by this was around 98%.
